3.4 SQL Algorithm
-- Algorithm for Data Manipulation in SQL Server

-- 3.3.1: Select all records from the database
SELECT * FROM dbo. [Covid];



-- 3.3.2: Share of people fully vaccinated
SELECT MAX (COALESCE (people_fully_vaccinated, 0)) AS people_fully_vaccinated_result
FROM [Covid];



-- 3.3.3: Share of people partially vaccinated
SELECT MAX (COALESCE (people_vaccinated, 0)) AS people_vaccinated_result
FROM [Covid];



-- 3.3.4: Share of people not vaccinated
SELECT MAX (COALESCE (population - people_vaccinated, 0)) AS people_not_vaccinated_result
FROM [Covid];



-- 3.3.5: People vaccinated per hundred per location
  select 
 [ Country],
 [people_vaccinated],
 [population],
 ([people_vaccinated] / [population]) * 100 as people_vaccinated_per_hundred
 from [dbo].[ Covid]
 where people_vaccinated_per_hundred is not null and [ Country] not in ('world', 'High income', 'lower middle income', 'upper middle income', 'low income')
 order by [population] desc;
  



-- 3.3.6: People vaccinated per hundred over GDP per capita
SELECT
    [Country],
    MAX([people_vaccinated_per_hundred]) AS MaxPeopleVaccinatedPerHundred,
    MAX([gdp_per_capita]) AS MaxGDPPerCapita
FROM
    [Covid]
GROUP BY
    [Country];

Explanation:
1.	3.3.1: Retrieve all records from the "Covid" table.
2.	3.3.2: Calculate the share of people fully vaccinated by selecting the maximum value of the "people_fully_vaccinated" column.
3.	3.3.3: Calculate the share of people partially vaccinated by selecting the maximum value of the "people_vaccinated" column.
4.	3.3.4: Calculate the share of people not vaccinated by subtracting the "people_vaccinated" from the total population.
5.	3.3.5: Calculate the number of people vaccinated per hundred per location, excluding records with null values for "People_vaccinated_per_hundred," and order the results by population in descending order.
6.	3.3.6: Calculate the maximum values of "People_vaccinated_per_hundred" and "gdp_per_capita" for each country, grouped by country.
These queries serve as the foundation for obtaining key metrics, allowing for insightful analysis and visualization in Tableau.
